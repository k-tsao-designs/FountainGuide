			<h3>Best Bathroom Award</h3>
			<p>
				Fountain on Locust received the “Best Bathroom Award” as a result of people all over the country and especially in the St. Louis area coming together to vote for this restaurant. It really helped get Fountain on Locust on the map, in the early years when things were hard, and brought tears to Joy’s eyes to talk about how grateful she was for the support.

			<h3>Furnishings</h3>
			<p>
				I stained these surfaces, too. Every surface had to be redone. I bought the bar in the front (the bar on the side is actually the back of that bar) at an estate sale in the Central West End from a lady who had a carriage house since the 70’s. </p>

			<p>When we opened, this was not a good neighborhood, so I was afraid to display alcohol right in the front. I thought we would get robbed all the time and there would be windows broken, so I put the alcohol bar on the side. Well, it really took a long time to educate people that we had alcohol and that we had a full bar, because typically ice cream places don’t have that.
