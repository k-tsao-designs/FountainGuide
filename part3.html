				<h3>Best Bathroom Award</h3>
				<div class="infotext">					
					<p>
						Fountain on Locust received the “Best Bathroom Award” as a result of people all over the country and especially in the St. Louis area coming together to vote for this restaurant. It really helped get Fountain on Locust on the map, in the early years when things were hard, and brought tears to Joy’s eyes to talk about how grateful she was for the support.

					I stained these surfaces, too. Every surface had to be redone. I bought the bar in the front (the bar on the side is actually the back of that bar) at an estate sale in the Central West End from a lady who had a carriage house since the 70’s. </p>

				<p>
					When we opened, this was not a good neighborhood, so I was afraid to display alcohol right in the front. I thought we would get robbed all the time and there would be windows broken, so I put the alcohol bar on the side. Well, it really took a long time to educate people that we had alcohol and that we had a full bar, because typically ice cream places don’t have that.

			<h3>Lightbox</h3>
			<div class="infotext">				
				<p>
					I went to Chicago, and wherever I was going I started taking pictures of all the Art Deco building architecture. When I came back I made stencils, like that stencil over there that’s the lightbox. I made that design, and the same design is in the hallway too.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I started doing the lightbox, at first, I went to Disney World, in Florida, and they have a restaurant with a lightbox, but not like this. It was plexiglass and it had horses running across it. It was a Western-themed thing. I liked the idea of the lightbox, having no idea at the time to check it out and see how they made it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I came back and thought all I had to do was make a box and paint my design on and put some light behind it and it would work. Well, it doesn’t work, because you see the hot spots of the lightbulbs. I tried everything! I tried Christmas lights, light bulbs, but they all showed the hot spot. So then I had to get some layers of film paper, that I got from the cinematography source down on Broadway in St. Louis, but then when I painted my design on the front, which was supposed to be a silhouette, you could see the brushstrokes when it was lit up from the back! That was really ugly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then I think it was, somebody said, “Why don’t you just go to the sign place and have somebody make that?” So, I did. I took my design and made it into a stencil for the hallway and then took it down there and said I needed however many feet of lightbox.
				</p>
				<p>
					But then when I went to pick it up, the girl who made the cutouts says, “I really liked this design. I made extra of it for my room!” I’m like, “Hey! Wait a minute!” But anyway, that happens all the time. Some lady came in here and she made all these greeting cards; she took pictures of our art and sells greeting cards with it on them! At the same time, I fashioned this after something, so nothing is, you know, original, and yet, I don't take an actual photograph of somebody’s actual artwork and sell it, I mean, you would think…but people don’t know. Anyway, that’s that!
