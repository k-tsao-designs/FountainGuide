				I had never been in the restaurant business before. I just wanted to make a place like this. I thought St. Louis needed a place like this. There are three things that go into a restaurant, and people say you can’t do all three, you can only do two of the three: a beautiful atmosphere, good food, and low prices. So, I set out to prove that you can do all three. And I guess the only way we could is, well, we bought the building.</p>

			<p>
				We actually bought this building for another business my husband and I have, which is a radio syndication company we’ve had for 35 years. I saw the front of the building though and I thought, oh! This should be a restaurant! Although, I didn’t know exactly what it would be; I thought it was going to be a chocolate bar, with actual shaved chocolate to order and liquid chocolate drinks. Well, that would have been a great idea if we were in a high traffic area, but as it is we never would have survived at all.
