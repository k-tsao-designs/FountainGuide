			<h3>Barbara, Manager</h3>
			<div class="infotext">
				<p>
					I was fortunate to have staff here. I found a lady, Barbara Schulz, who likes to do this. She doesn’t like others—she likes to operate, and I like to create. I didn’t have her in the beginning, and it was really terrible and horrible. I lost money and many nights of sleep. I had to sleep in my car. There’s a story for you.

			<h3>Soda Fountain</h3>
			<div class="infotext">				
				<p>
					I had seen the movie Aviator which took place in the 30’s, and soda fountains came up in popularity in the 30’s. It was a place where everybody could go. Back then, women couldn’t drink alcohol. There were saloons, and there were not-saloons. If you went to a saloon, then you were a big floozy! But then there were soda fountains, and it was ok to have a drink at a soda fountain, because it was a real friendly, above board place, and you know, they had medicines. At that time everything was intertwined: medicine, alcohol, ice creams, soda fountain drinks, and all of this. This is exactly what we ended up having here.

			<h3>Ice Cream Martini</h3>			
			<div class="infotext">
				<p>
					I had the ice cream martini concept, which just came to me, I don’t know why, because it’s not like I invented it. Although I thought I invented it. It doesn’t make sense though because you can think of the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander that have been around since the beginning of time. Those are both ice cream drinks.</p>

				<p>
					I was going around saying, “I’m going to open this place and everybody was like ‘oh yeah, ho hum whatever,’ and it’s going to have liquid chocolate, ‘yeah yeah, that sounds good,’ and it’s going to have ice cream martinis! ‘Oh! Ice cream martinis!’” Everybody was really picking up on the ice cream martini idea. And since I said it all over the place I was like, “oh my God, what if this doesn’t work?” ‘Cause I had forgotten about the fact that there was a Brandy Alexander and a Grasshopper. I thought that I had invented this concept. I was afraid that if I mixed ice cream and alcohol it would separate; it wasn’t going to blend and it wasn’t going to work out. Thank God it did!
