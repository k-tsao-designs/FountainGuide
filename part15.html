			<h3>Killian</h3>
			<p>
				Killian credits the Fountain on Locust with his personal development. He says he was a lost youth when he started working in the kitchen washing dishes, but it provided structure for him during his formative years. He gradually moved his way up to being a server in the front through all the tiers of restaurant service. Now he has a girlfriend, a job, his own apartment, and is even attending grad school!

			<h3>The Fountain Family</h3>
			<p>
				Barbara and Killian both emphasized that the Fountain group is like a family. People are there for each other and know how to function as a team so that if one person is overwhelmed another will cover their back. People work here for a surprisingly long time considering the standard restaurant industry turnover is so high. Some managers at the Fountain have been here for 8 years.  A lot of people also keep coming back even after theyâ€™ve moved on to other things in their lives and when they drop in just casually start working because by that time they know every job!
