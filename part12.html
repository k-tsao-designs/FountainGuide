			<h3>Chili Recipes</h3>
			<p>
				Over the years, we’ve had recipes come from everywhere, from our staff, from customers, one time, from that famous coach at SLU. He brought us his mom’s recipe, his sacred chili recipe. Then, we did this whole customer chili of the week. Customers would submit their chili recipes and we would pick one and we would make it. That person got to bring their friends and have free chili that week and be the star of the week and that was a bunch of fun, but we quit doing it. We just quit having chili except for the chili conchata.

			<h3>Roast Beef Melt (for the men)</h3>
			<p>
				My favorite is the signature mixed salad sandwich—the original style, not with the chicken. I also like our Fountain Cuban, and I like our daily specials. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The biggest seller is something I don’t like at all. It’s the Hot Roast Beef Melt. I think it’s boring. I mean, as far as roast beef melts go I think it’s one of the better ones and the customers seem to think so. They’re always raving about it. But, it’s so cliché. I’m not that big of a meat eater to begin with, and ours has caramelized onions in it and rosemary, which is a little different, but still… It’s nothing to write home about in my mind but people love it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I think, “Gah! Expand your horizons! There are so many better things on the menu.” But, it’s the biggest seller. You kind of have to listen to the crowd. We have Budlight because most people order Budlight. You’ll have a great craft beer and Budlight outsells it five to one. It’s just what people know. So, you try to introduce them to the deliciousness of all these other things and they don’t stretch out of their comfort zone too much.
