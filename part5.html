			<h3>Setting Prices</h3>
			<div class="infotext">				
				<p>
					We could charge more. If you go to a place that has high prices, which I never go to because it pisses me off. There’s no reason for it other than just to gouge the customer and take as much money as you can. That’s another thing: I wanted people to be happy when they left here. It’s one thing to be happy while you’re here and enjoying the great food and nice atmosphere, but you don’t want to be like, “Ouch, my wallet hurts” when you leave. 
				</p>
				<p>
					People say I could charge more for this because it’s not just frozen food that a lot of places just get from the food suppliers and heat up. We do make everything from scratch so it’s harder. I thought we would find the audience that would appreciate that, and understand that this is a good value as well as good food. Of course, we have found it, although it took forever. On the overall though, just as I would say the hot roast beef melt is the bestseller, you can charge high prices and people will think food is good just because it has a high price. That’s what I’ve come to learn just by doing a volume business. It’s what you choose though. That’s not what I choose to do. That’s not the reason I did this. There’s a million restaurants who do that, so why have a restaurant just to do that? I wanted a restaurant I would hope people would understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, if you don’t put a dollar sign, and if you have a choice between saying $8.99 and $9 it really makes a difference to say $8.99. If 8 is the first thing that enters your head you still think you’re in the $8 category instead of the $9 category even though it’s a penny different. I leaned that over time. Also, placement on the menu! The first thing you have and the last thing you have are the important spots. Who knew? You would think something in the middle would be the big showcase spot. What they tell you to do and we never really did was to put an expensive thing on the menu so it makes everything else look like a really good price. But, we don’t do that because our stuff is a really good price! All we do is figure out how much it costs, and how much it costs to sell it here.
