			<h3>The Malt Mistake</h3>
			<div class="infotext">				
				<p>
					It was me in the beginning, and I couldn’t afford to hire very many people. I had three people and myself. The business was so sporadic that it was really hard to offer good service. We would have a day where there was no business, so I was the only one in the restaurant.
				</p> 
				<p>
					A table of six comes in. Well, they all want malts! Malts are one of the worst things that you can make behind the ice cream bar because they’re very labor intensive and they take a long time, unless you go to Jack-in-the-Box and it comes out of a machine, but that’s not what we’re doing here.
				</p>
				<p>
					We had to actually get rid of some of the things we had on the menu, like we used to have lattes, and we got rid of the espresso machine, cause the ice cream’s like a kitchen in itself in the front, and we have a bar, and we’re doing cocktails, which is another kitchen, and then you’ve got the kitchen itself. Something has to go, or it’ll take people forty minutes to get their food.
				</p>
				<p>
					So this table of six comes in, and they order sandwiches and malts. Every one of them has a malt, so already I’m a little shaky. So I go back, and make all the food, and I come back to make the malts. I’m like, “Oh my God! It’s taking so long!” I’m trying to hurry so much because I’m doing it all myself and it’s taking too long and they’re going to be pissed! 
				</p>
				<p>
					I make all the malts, and I put them on the tray, and I knocked it all over! All of the malts run, not just all over to make a mess, but into the ice cream cabinet, like inside the ice cream! It couldn’t have been worse. It was the biggest disaster. I just wanted to cry and walk out the door.

			<h3>Soups</h3>
			<div class="infotext">				
				<p>
					I think that people that are artistic are also good cooks, because you have a creative sense and you can taste things in your mind. Believe it or not, a lot of people can’t do that. Creative people have a sense of what would go well with something else. When we opened, I kind of opened with the dishes that were my go-to tried and trues for dinner parties that I had had for years and some of that worked and some of that didn’t.
				</p>

				<p>When we opened, we had two too-weird soups. We had the pickle soup and roasted peanut soup and we realized one of them had to go because it was just too much weird stuff. It was overwhelmingly weird. We let the peanut soup go into rotation and we kept the pickle soup. Just recently we had a guy come in and buy a whole gallon of pickle soup because he was going to a Strange Food dinner party.</p>

				<p>Pickle soup is good, but I have to tell you, we have 47 different soups in rotation, and some of our soups are so far superior to the pickle soup, but they’re so labor intensive we can’t make them on a daily basis. The pickle soup is just a daily one.</p>

				<p>
					The ones where we have to cut up a whole bunch of ingredients right there is a hardship, and things that don’t keep well are also a problem. We have “Chicken and Hand-cut Dumplings.” That’s a little labor-intensive because of the hand-cut dumplings, and it probably wouldn’t keep very well very long, but we don’t have to worry about it because it sells out right away. Everybody loves it.
