			<h3>The Malt Mistake</h3>
			<p>
				Joy told a story about how early on she had a sudden rush of customers who ALL ordered malts. Malts are one of the most difficult things to make on the menu, and she was the only one in the shop. After she finally got all six malts made, while stressing about how she had kept the entire table waiting for so long, she tripped and spilled all the malts directly into the ice cream refrigerator, which was the worst place possible! Everything was ruined. It was one of the most difficult moments in her young career as a restaurant owner.

			<h3>Soups</h3>
			<p>
				I think that people that are artistic are also good cooks, because you have a creative sense and you can taste things in your mind. Believe it or not, a lot of people can’t do that. Creative people have a sense of what would go well with something else. When we opened, I kind of opened with the dishes that were my go-to tried and trues for dinner parties that I had had for years and some of that worked and some of that didn’t.
			</p>

<p>When we opened, we had two too-weird soups. We had the pickle soup and roasted peanut soup and we realized one of them had to go because it was just too much weird stuff. It was overwhelmingly weird. We let the peanut soup go into rotation and we kept the pickle soup. Just recently we had a guy come in and buy a whole gallon of pickle soup because he was going to a Strange Food dinner party.</p>

<p>Pickle soup is good, but I have to tell you, we have 47 different soups in rotation, and some of our soups are so far superior to the pickle soup, but they’re so labor intensive we can’t make them on a daily basis. The pickle soup is just a daily one.</p>

			<p>
				The ones where we have to cut up a whole bunch of ingredients right there is a hardship, and things that don’t keep well are also a problem. We have “Chicken and Hand-cut Dumplings.” That’s a little labor-intensive because of the hand-cut dumplings, and it probably wouldn’t keep very well very long, but we don’t have to worry about it because it sells out right away. Everybody loves it.
