			<h3>"We've got good people."</h3>
			<p>
				Joy emphasized that the Fountain wouldn’t be what it is without the people. Because they opened in 2008, business was slow, but they also were able to hire a lot of really good workers who were in fact overqualified for their jobs but couldn’t find other work. Those really quality people kept the Fountain alive during that difficult time.

			<h3>Handmade Lampshades</h3>
			<p>
				I made these lampshades. These are not the typical kind I make; I make fancy Victorian antique-style lampshades. People are always like, “How do you make lampshades?” Or, “Make me a lampshade!” is usually what they say. I don’t have time to make a lampshade, so I made a video on how to make a lampshade to just say, “Here! Here’s a video, now you make your own lampshade. Other lampshade makers were angry that I exposed the secret or whatever, which was not really a secret. You can pretty much figure it out yourself if you deconstructed a lampshade. But still, they were angry, as if I had given away the secret family recipe.

				I think we say on our menu that the pickle soup is a secret family recipe. But the only reason we say that is it sounds like its better! Because you can get the recipe online—we even put it on our website.
