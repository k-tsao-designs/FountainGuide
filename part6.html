			<h3>Hand-painted murals</h3>
			<div class="infotext">
				<p>
					I’ve painted murals all my life. I had just come off doing a big mural—by the way, I don’t do them for hire, although I’ve been approached a couple of times for doing them for hire and then when I give people prices, they want me to do them for free. 
				</p>

				<p>It took me two years to paint this place because I did it all by myself. That was a mistake. I would never do it again. The problem was that I didn’t plan things. I’m the type of person who says, “Oh! Let’s do this!” So I just started doing it, and here I am in the middle saying, “Oh, I wish I had planned it.” I couldn’t tell anybody what to do to help me because I didn’t know what I was doing myself. I was just trying to get it done.</p>


				<p>Well, here I was painting the walls for literally two years, and not every day—it didn’t take that long. It was just that I would only get a couple of hours one day and a couple of hours another day, maybe two days a week, so that was why it stretched out over that amount of time.</p>

				<p>I had a rough idea based on the Aviator movie, where the ceiling was painted with stars, that I would do that over in the bar area, because I thought nobody would want to go in the low area and I had to make it really beautiful just so people would go there. Since I started going really fast and winging it I didn’t have an idea for the big space and I just kept going with the blue idea. Turns out now, the bar area is always the most popular, because it’s more intimate. It’s not so big and exposed. People like to go back there because it’s cozier and they can be more private back there.</p>

				<p>Each time I did something, I didn’t know what I was doing, but I knew I was going to have these ladies with the torches. At least I knew that, because I had it wired for the electrician to have the torches—but of course they weren’t in the right spot. Haha, erm… But then I had to make the ladies and then I thought, “What do I do with this space? I didn’t realize it was so big.” So, I kept referring back to Art Deco things that I could find in books or life.</p>

				<p>So this is supposed to be a soda fountain. These brown things with silver squiggles are actually a fountain. But Art Deco is so hard to do. It looks so easy. It looks so geometric. It looks like a children’s drawing, almost, and yet to actually paint it you have to have straight lines, and you have to have opaque colors, so it takes two or three coats. It’s much easier to paint a vista, like a typical Italian mural that’s real soft; it has dimension; it’s a scene, or something like that. That is way more forgiving. It comes out looking fantastic and you don’t have to put so much work into it. You can do it in one session.</p>

				<p>I’ll tell you a secret right now. When you’re painting a mural like that, if you want it to look aged and natural to its environment and not too new and bright: don’t change your water! Let your water get dirty and keep using the dirty water! It comes out looking great. I’ll just pass that along.</p>
