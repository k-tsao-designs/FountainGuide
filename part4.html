			<h3>Candied Orange Peels</h3>
			<p>
				Barbara described the actual recipe and process for making candied orange peels, which is four days long. They are Joy’s invention, too, and one of the unique things that they put on top of their martinis instead of a traditional maraschino cherry. They also sell the candied orange peels by themselves or dipped in chocolate.

			<h3>Learning the Kitchen</h3>
			<p>
				I had no idea, that’s how naïve I was. I thought that I was helping out by working for free for a day. Obviously, I wanted to figure out what was going on, and I told them, “I’m opening a restaurant and I don’t know anything! Can I work here for a day? I’ll do it for free!” Like that was a big deal. I’ll start to cry when I tell you this, because I was so grateful to these people. I went to nine restaurants and eight of them let me do it. Honestly, now that I know what I know, they were just being nice, because I’m just in their way. I’m not helping them. Anybody who comes in the door, working for free, is in the way.</p>

			<p>
				I always feel like I have to give back to anybody who wants to come in and learn something or know something. I’m not somebody to not share a recipe. I don’t care! I’m not somebody who has a secret, like it’s a big secret recipe.
