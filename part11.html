			<h3>Cedar Crest, the Only Source for Aged Ice Cream</h3>
			<p>
				I tasted this ice cream, Cedar Crest ice cream, which is the only ice cream that is aged, and I thought “Oh my goodness this is so good; somebody has got to bring it to St. Louis!” Not thinking, it would be me.

			<h3>Rooftop Birthday</h3>
			<p>
				When reminiscing about stories from Fountain, Dakota said that one of his most precious memories is the time that after working a 10 hour shift at this and his other job and just wanting to utterly collapse at the end of the night, he came back to find that his coworkers at the Fountain had thrown him a surprise party with pizza and beer for all! They even went up on the rooftop to hang out, and he had a great time.

			<h3>Drink Identification</h3>
			<p>
				Dakota also passed on the pro tip that how the Fountain team makes sure to get the order right is to have a very distinct presentation for each drink, considering they have so many on the menu. Each one has a unique topper, candied orange peel or otherwise, so that servers won’t get them mixed up.
