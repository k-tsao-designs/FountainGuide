			<h3>Romance at the Fountain</h3>
			<div class="infotext">
				<p>
					We’ve had a lot of people get married that met here, and that’s really nice, that there are life changes. We have a number of people, in fact one couple, who came early on. In fact, they met here. They had a blind first date, so they viewed each other for the first time here. And then, they got married. Then, they had children. They came back on their anniversary, the day they met, when they had their children and it was just really nice that that-all happened as a result of this.
				</p>
				<p>
					We had a guy tell his server to put his engagement ring inside the World’s Smallest Hot Fudge Sundae and give it to his soon-to-be fiancée. How could she say no after that?
				</p>
				<p>
					We had this one little lady who kept calling because she wanted the coconut curry chickpea soup. That was her favorite!  She would say, “Are you making it today?” We just make things sort of in a random rotation. You can’t ever predict when something’s going to be in the soup rotation because it’s just based on how fast it sells out. So, she finally got lucky that we had the coconut curry chickpea soup and she says, “Oh, I’m so glad you have it! I’m going to come in and get some to go because I think it will be perfect for date night!” And then when she comes in she was well over 70 years old! It was so cute!

					Killian told a story about a German woman who comes back yearly to St. Louis for business and makes it a point to come back to the Fountain every year. It really touches him that he can give someone an experience so good that sticks in their memory so much that they would cross the world and still come back every time.
